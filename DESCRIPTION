Description: This package carries out most common analysis when
        performing whole genome association studies. These analyses
        include descriptive statistics and exploratory analysis of
        missing values, calculation of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium,
        analysis of association based on generalized linear models
        (either for quantitative or binary traits), and analysis of
        multiple SNPs (haplotype and epistasis analysis). Permutation
        test and related tests (sum statistic and truncated product)
        are also implemented.
