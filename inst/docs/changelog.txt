v1.4-4
2007-03-02
- bug fixed in the function 'intervals.haplo.glm'
- added new functions: codominant.snp, dominant.snp, recessive.snp, overdominant.snp 
- [.WGassociation is able to select using logical statements 
- [.setupSNP recover 'allele.labels' from the SNPs
- perm.Test changed options(warn=-1) to avoid waning messages to fit the beta distribution

v1.4-3
2007-01-22
- removed the file Makevars.win to ../src 
- changed SNPassoc.f to be compiled using g77
- \usage sections for 'SNPassoc-internal' 'plot.WGassociation' and 'snp' have been fixed for S3 methods

v1.4-2
2007-01-19
- added the file Makevars.win to ../src 

v1.4-1
2007-01-17
- minor changes in scanWGassociation
- implemented rank truncated product in permTest function

v1.4
2006-12-12
- minor changes in print.WGassociation 
- zzz.R is replaced by firstlib.R
- firstlib.R calls to a Fortran dll
- created a Fortran program SNPassoc.f which is called from scanWGassociation
- added a new argument to scanWGassociation function called "nperm"
- added a new function called permTest to extract p values from permutation test obtained using scanWGassociation function
- added methods for objects of class "permTest"

v1.3  
2006-11-27
- snp, summary.snp and expandsetupSNP fixed to deal with SNP with 100% missing information

2006-11-26
- manual for WGstats moved to WGassociation
- summary.GWassociation (previous WGstats) fixed

2006-11-25
- interactionPval now accepts only response and asumes formula response~1
- summary.WGassociation and WGstats swapped
- summary.WGassociation generates output even if no info is supplied (whole dataset)

2006-11-23
- added methods for extraction and modification of setupSNP and WGassociation objects 
- genetic model functions generic
	-methods: default: recode (accepts snp, numeric, factor or character max 3 values)
		  WGassociation: extracts pvalues for that model
