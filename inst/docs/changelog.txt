v1.4-9
2007-10-16
- modified: expandsetupSNP.R to show alleles sorted by frequency when summary of an object of class 'setupSNP' is executed
- changed: e-mail address of the maintainer
- removed: obsolete markup \non_function{}


v1.4-8
2007-05-21
- mvtnorm is required (change in DESCRIPTION, NAMESPACE and firstlib.R)
- added: new generic function maxstat (to compute asymptotic p values for max-statistic) and some methods
- added: function for inspecting overdispersion due to population substructure (qqpval)
- added: function for correcting the p values using genomic control (GenomiControl)
- added: example in the Rd file for odds function
- added: argument nIndiv in association.fit (to deal with genotypeRate properly). association has also been changed (look for 'nSubject')
- minor change in the function snp (when snp is applied to an object of class snp)
- added: reference of SNPassoc to some .Rd files


v1.4-7
2007-05-17
- bug fixed: overdominant returned wrong levels (thanks to Nicholas Orr)

2007-05-02
- bug fixed: [<-.setupSNP  added any variable as new SNP, but could be a covariate
- bug fixed: odds returns NA for monomorphic SNPs
- bug fixed: association.fit detected monomorphic SNPs that were not so

2007-04-02
-bug fixed: c.WGassociation when more than 2 files were combined
-bug fixed: [.WGassociation when rows/columns were selected by name wrong selection was done
-bug fixed: [.WGassociation now also subsets permuted SNPs if available
-changed: [.setupSNP should be faster and preserve snp attributes
-changed: glm2 in table.corner updated to avoid warnings if response was factor
-new function odds to extract odds ratios, 95% CI and p values for a given model from an WGassociation object
-new function [.snp, version of factor that preserves attributes
-new function print.snp


v1.4-6
2007-03-22
- change in 'association' function to deal with SNP with 0% of genotype rate (e.g. all missing) when ajusted models are fitted

v1.4-5
2007-03-20
- bug fixed in the output labels for overdominant model

v1.4-4
2007-03-02
- bug fixed in the function 'intervals.haplo.glm'
- added new functions: codominant.snp, dominant.snp, recessive.snp, overdominant.snp 
- [.WGassociation is able to select using logical statements 
- [.setupSNP recover 'allele.labels' from the SNPs
- perm.Test changed options(warn=-1) to avoid waning messages to fit the beta distribution

v1.4-3
2007-01-22
- removed the file Makevars.win to ../src 
- changed SNPassoc.f to be compiled using g77
- \usage sections for 'SNPassoc-internal' 'plot.WGassociation' and 'snp' have been fixed for S3 methods

v1.4-2
2007-01-19
- added the file Makevars.win to ../src 

v1.4-1
2007-01-17
- minor changes in scanWGassociation
- implemented rank truncated product in permTest function

v1.4
2006-12-12
- minor changes in print.WGassociation 
- zzz.R is replaced by firstlib.R
- firstlib.R calls to a Fortran dll
- created a Fortran program SNPassoc.f which is called from scanWGassociation
- added a new argument to scanWGassociation function called "nperm"
- added a new function called permTest to extract p values from permutation test obtained using scanWGassociation function
- added methods for objects of class "permTest"

v1.3  
2006-11-27
- snp, summary.snp and expandsetupSNP fixed to deal with SNP with 100% missing information

2006-11-26
- manual for WGstats moved to WGassociation
- summary.GWassociation (previous WGstats) fixed

2006-11-25
- interactionPval now accepts only response and asumes formula response~1
- summary.WGassociation and WGstats swapped
- summary.WGassociation generates output even if no info is supplied (whole dataset)

2006-11-23
- added methods for extraction and modification of setupSNP and WGassociation objects 
- genetic model functions generic
	-methods: default: recode (accepts snp, numeric, factor or character max 3 values)
		  WGassociation: extracts pvalues for that model
