- minor changes in scanWGassociation
- implemented rank truncated product in permTest function

v1.4

- zzz.R is replaced by firstlib.R
- firstlib.R calls to a Fortran dll
- created a Fortran program SNPassoc.f which is called from scanWGassociation
- added a new argument to scanWGassociation function called "nperm"
- added a new function called permTest to extract p values from permutation test obtained using scanWGassociation function
- added methods for objects of class "permTest"

v1.3  
2006-11-27
- snp, summary.snp and expandsetupSNP fixed to deal with SNP with 100% missing information

2006-11-26
- manual for WGstats moved to WGassociation
- summary.GWassociation (previous WGstats) fixed

2006-11-25
- interactionPval now accepts only response and asumes formula response~1
- summary.WGassociation and WGstats swapped
- summary.WGassociation generates output even if no info is supplied (whole dataset)

2006-11-23
- added methods for extraction and modification of setupSNP and WGassociation objects

	-methods: default: recode (accepts snp, numeric, factor or character max 3 values)
		  WGassociation: extracts pvalues for that model
